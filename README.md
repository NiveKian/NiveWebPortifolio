# My personal Website

This website was made as a personal web-potifolio for presenting my skills.

It was made using Javascript, ReactJS, Tailwind and Vite.
I used github user machadop1407 portifolio as an example to make my own custom portifolio.

The website is just to showcase my projects and contacts as im more of an backend guy.
Hope you like it :D
